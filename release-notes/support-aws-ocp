Support was added in shipyard to easily create test clusters using OCP on top of AWS.
This allows developers and users to easily stand up a test/PoC environment with Submariner using AWS+OCP.
The deployed environment will use the latest published Submariner images, it's currently not possible to use locally built images.

The following commands are supported:
* `make clusters using=aws-ocp`
* `make deploy using=aws-ocp`
* `make e2e using=aws-ocp`
* `make cleanup using=aws-ocp`
